<h3 align="center"> About Me </h3>
I am a junior software developer. I started my career in the US Army as an Air Defense Artillery officer, and transitioned as a civilian to continue my career in operations and project management. I have excelled as a leader, planner, and strategist, but am ready to continue on with the next part of my career in softrware development.

<h3 align="center"> My Dev Journey </h3>
While I have dabbled in programming throughout the years, self-learning languages like HTML, CSS, Python, Java, and Swift, I started developing apps for iOS as a hobby in early 2022. After realizing I was not satisfied with my current career path, I decided to make a positive change and pursue iOS development full-time. Since then, I have worked tirelessly improving my skills in Swift, SwiftUI, and other supporting languages like JavaScript, React, and React Native. While I wanted to attend an accredited Dev Bootcamp, I did not have the time or the financial resources to do so. Instead, I set myself to a strict, self-paced learning programming and completed the iOS Developer Professional Certification created by Meta and learned from the iOS Dev community.

Now, to better market myself and learn more than just iOS, I am a student at Coding Dojo learning full-stack development in Python, JavaScript, and C#/.NET.
